# Name-based Access Control - Group Key Demonstration

## Summary

Demonstrating the handling and interactions required for group keys as described in NAC for the NDN architecture, with some corners cut for design and time reasons.

Performed on the FABRIC testbed using Python scripts alongside the JuPyter server hub for FABRIC to simulate NDN nodes.

Also contains a notebook with an incomplete attempt at performing the above exchange using NDN-DPDK.
The difficulty of configuring and debugging NDN-DPDK on FABRIC at this time means it is currently not functional.
