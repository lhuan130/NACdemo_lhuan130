# Name-based Access Control - Group Key Demonstration

## Summary

Demonstrating the key handling of group keys as described in NAC for the NDN architecture.
Performed on the FABRIC testbed using Python scripts to simulate NDN nodes, given the compatibility and resource requirements of existing NDN implementations.

Also contains a notebook with an incomplete attempt at performing the above exchange using NDN-DPDK.
The difficulty of configuring and debugging NDN-DPDK on FABRIC at this time means it is currently not functional.
